# Lung Cancer Prediction

This Jupyter Notebook contains code for building a machine learning model to predict lung cancer based on various features such as age, gender, smoking, anxiety, etc. The model aims to provide accurate predictions to assist patients and doctors in predicting lung cancer accurately.

## Files

- **lung_cancer_prediction.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
- **survey_lung_cancer.csv**: Sample dataset containing features and the target variable.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

## Usage

### 1. Data Preparation

Ensure the `survey_lung_cancer.csv` dataset is available in the same directory as the notebook.

### 2. Environment Setup

Install the required Python libraries using ipynb kernel.

### 3. Run Notebook

Open and execute the `lung_cancer_prediction.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook.

### 4. Follow Instructions

Follow the instructions within the notebook to preprocess data, train the model, evaluate performance, and make predictions.

### 5. Interpret Results

Analyze model performance metrics and predicted lung cancer outcomes to gain insights into the dataset.
